# Image-Stitching-Into-Panoramas
Implementing various types of features for stitching images planar and cylindrical perspective and comparing results with the original panorama.

In this project implemented features are Harris dots, SIFT, SURF and ORB features. Each feature selection is implemented and the results are compared with themselves and the original function in OpenCV platform.

The whole project you can see [here](https://github.com/Uros-Petkovic/Image-Stitching-Into-Panoramas/blob/main/main.py).

In folders are photos which are taken individual. These photos are used for getting results.

Also, you can see my paper of Master Thesis [here](https://github.com/Uros-Petkovic/Image-Stitching-Into-Panoramas/blob/main/Master_rad.pdf).
